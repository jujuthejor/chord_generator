# Chord Generator
## Description
This is a CLI application which has two modes. The first mode is listing all possible chords of a root note of the user's choosing. The second mode prints out random chords. The number of chords to be displayed is given by the user.

## Supported chords
Chord Generator can currently display the following chords:
- triads (major, minor, augmented, diminished)
- sevenths (major, minor, dominant only)
- suspended

Other types of chords (e.g. extended chords and the other variations of seventh chords) will implemented soon.

## Dependencies
The following must be already installed prior to building the project:
- gcc >=8.1.0
- make >=4.2.1

This program was built in a Windows 10 machine with mingw-w64. Compiling using Unix-like systems is yet to be determined.
